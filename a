<p>I have known for a long time that Anne Fadiman's <i>The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</i> is a must read if you want to learn about the Hmong. I thought I was the only Hmong English reading student who have not read. So I asked my Facebook friends and received a paperback copy and a PDF copy. This is going to be the summer I actually finish reading a book. I'm going to write my reactions here. When I asked for the book there are friends who hated it and some who enjoyed it. Here is my thoughts after reading up to page 4.</p>
<p>In page 4 of The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, Anne wrote: "A txiv neeb might be able to cure infertility by asking the couple to sacrifice a dog, a cat, a chicken, or a sheep. After the animal's throat was cut, the txiv neeb would string a rope bridge from the doorpost to the marriage bed, over which the soul of the couple's future baby, which had been detained by a malevolent spirit called a dab, could now freely travel to earth."
Wait…</p>
<p>1. This is the first time I am learning about the cat sacrificing ritual. What? This is a first. Can someone tell me more about when it is appropriate to sacrifice a cat?</p>
<p>2. The word dab here is used in a negative connotation in “malevolent spirit called a dab.” Oh, that's fucked up. That's like saying "malevolent animal called a dog." Um, not all dogs are bad but why specifically attach that description to that animal?</p>
<p>The word malevolent means “having or showing a wish to do evil to others.”</p>
<p>The word dab, however, is not the name of a spirit that wish to do evil to others. The word dab is encompassing of different kinds of spirits, good and bad. For example, my mother is a shaman and she was called upon to be a shaman by her dab neeb. Neeb comes from “ua neeb,” which is the act that the shaman do in entering into a trance and into the Other world to negotiate and/or retrieve souls or communicate with spirits or ancestors. But the dab neeb are not malevolent spirits.
The Hmong practice animism, which we translate to “ntseeg dab” (literal translate = believe in spirits). Some Hmong Christians will try to fool you because of their belief that to ntseeg dab is to believe in the devil. There is no equivalent of Lucifer in the Hmong’s cosmology, even though Quincy and Vincent K. Her said Ntxij Nyoog, who governs the Dab Teb (spirit world) is the equivalent to Lucifer. I don’t align with that because Hmong people don’t use Ntxij Nyoog to scare our people the same way Lucifer has been used to scare Christians for forever. In Christianity, Lucifer represents all sins and he constantly tries to influence you to do bad things. Growing up, I don’t remember my parents attributing my sins to Ntxij Nyoog. Hmong people are not afraid of Ntxij Nyoog the way Christians are afraid of the devil. We are afraid of malevolent dab.</p>
<p>If you read the sentence “a malevolent spirit called a dab," it reads as a dab is a malevolent spirit. Anne should have written “a malevolent dab” and then translate it to “a malevolent spirit.” Even Vincent translated the Dab Teb to Spirit World, literally: Dab is Spirit and Teb is World. So, my point is a dab is not a malevolent spirit. However, there are malevolent dab. C’mon Anne, don’t be scaring white people like that.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert. I just have lived experience.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you put the word dab into the first box in Google translate and translate into English, dab = fire. If you reverse it and translate “ghost” from English to Hmong, ghost = dab. Wait, then if dab = fire and ghost = dab then fire = dab? C’mon, Google. Yet, this is interesting though (calling all Linguists out there): ghosts aren’t entirely “malevolent.” So if dab = ghost, then Anne fucked up here because if we follow her definition then Casper wasn’t a dab because Casper wasn’t a “malevolent spirit” but Casper was a ghost though. Huh?</p>
